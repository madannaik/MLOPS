# MLOps : machine learning and operations
***This document discusses techniques for implementing and automating continuous integration (CI) of machine learning (ML) system***  

Data science and ML are becoming core capabilities for solving complex real-world problems, transforming industries, and delivering value in all domains. Currently, the ingredients for applying effective ML are available to you:
  * Large datasets
  * Inexpensive on-demand compute resources
  * Rapid advances in different ML research fields.

Therefore, many businesses are investing in their data science teams and ML capabilities to develop predictive models that can deliver business value to their users.

This project documentation is for data scientists and ML engineers who want to apply **DevOps** principles to ML systems **(MLOps)**. **MLOps** is an ML engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops). Practicing MLOps means that you advocate for automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing etc.
